            After 3 long months, this crew is happy to be on the Martini Shot (final shot of principle photography). You
            are the crew for this last shot, the electricity is a bit faulty and the director is a bit ... eccentric. If
            you can get this last 45 second shot, you get to go home and have a nice vacation before your next shoot.
          </p>
          <p class="instruction-text-1">
            - Camera Operator: (Roll Camera) The director wants this to be shot like a documentary, so you need to make
            sure that the camera is always rolling. Don't let frames count down to 0!
          </p>
          <p class="instruction-text-2">
            - 2nd AC: (Reload Mag), Make sure the film in the camera doesn't run out. You're in charge of reloading film
            into the camera any time it gets low. Your game ends if you're out of film. You can only reload if you're
            down to 3 or less film strips.
          </p>
          <p class="instruction-text-3">
            - Gaffer: (Lights!) The electricity in this old studio is a bit unreliable. Make sure the lights stay on,
            you won't be able to reload film if the lights are off because you can't see!

            The director is shouting that the crew is ruining their vision. Although you've been working for 12 hours,
            they're willing to take this shoot into overtime. Everybody needs to go back to their first position and go
            again!
